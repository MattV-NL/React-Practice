## Description

This is a project using React.js that I created with my background of the construction industry in mind. This is the front end of the project, the back end can be found here https://github.com/MattV-NL/Workster-Server

This project will allow a user to enter information regarding the work they have in their work scope. The app will then display the information in charts and tables for the user to see. The weather information is retreived from an API based on the users location.

A user can see the details of the work information they entered by clicking on the cell in the table of the data they want to inspect.

## Motivation

I chose to build this project as I was working throughout the winter outside in the elements. Often we would be caught working out in snow storms and have work inside on days with calmer weather. So I thought that I the person planning the workscope had an easy way to see if there was weather during days when work was to be scheduled outside then perhaps that person could reevaluate the work scope and possibly rescedule the work on another day.

## Deployment
This project was deployed with Linode and was live for several months, due to this being a hobby project I do no feel it nessecary to continue to pay for this deployment.
If you want to see this app in action please visit https://www.loom.com/share/dbf61781d3634ee6ab5a0cf4a3a7f1a9 where you will find a video demo of the app. Otherwise you can reach out to em at any of the contacts in my profile README.md and I'll gladly get back to you! :)
