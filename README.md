## Description
This is a project using React.js that I created with my background of the construction industry in mind. [https://mattv-nl.github.io/Work-Weather-Analyzer/](https://github.com/MattV-NL/Work-Weather-Analyzer)

This project will allow a user to enter information regarding the work they have in their work scope as well as information about the weather affecting their work scope. The app will then display the information in charts and tables for the user to see.

## Motivation
I chose to build this project as I was working throughout the winter outside in the elements. Often we would be caught working out in snow storms and have work inside on days with calmer weather. So I thought that I the person planning the workscope had an easy way to see if there was weather during days when work was to be scheduled outside then perhaps that person could reevaluate the work scope and possibly rescedule the work on another day.
